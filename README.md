# ARObjectSelection

A quick image segmentation test for AR.
Imagine real world objects  being highlighted/selectable, recoloured/labeled or having quick action buttons.

This very simple test extracts the hue of the AR video feed, resamples to squash hue ranges, applies a sobel filter and puts it back on top of the feed.

Use Unity 2019.3.4f1 and ARFoundation.

Warning, I hard coded the screen resolution! Not production ready.
